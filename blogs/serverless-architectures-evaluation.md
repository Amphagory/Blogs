# Overview

In this blog, I will stand up a simple API using AWS Lambda and Azure Functions to perform a general evaluation.

## Background

What does Serverless mean?

As a developer, serverless means that I do not need to worry about servers.

From Wikipedia:
Serverless computing is a cloud-computing execution model in which the cloud provider runs the server, and dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources. Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by an application, rather than on pre-purchased units of capacity.

Serverless computing can simplify the process of deploying code into production. Scaling, capacity planning and maintenance operations may be hidden from the developer or operator. Serverless code can be used in conjunction with code deployed in traditional styles, such as microservices. Alternatively, applications can be written to be purely serverless and use no provisioned servers at all.

## Let's start!
